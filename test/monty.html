    <main>
            <p>Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:
Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. (Your goal, obviously,
is to end up with the car).</p>
<table>
    <tr><th>Hypothesis</th><th>Prior</th></tr>
    <tr><td>door 1</td><td>33.3%</td></tr> <tr><td>door 2</td><td>33.3%</td></tr> <tr><td>door 3</td><td>33.3%</td></tr>
</table><p>You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors,
opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you
want to pick door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?</p>
<p>If the car were behind door 1, then the host would randomly pick between
doors 2 and 3 to reveal. If the car were behind door 2, the host would have to
show you door 3. If the car were behind door 3, then the host couldn't show us
that door.</p>
<strong>Evidence: being shown door 3</strong>
<table>
    <tr><th>Hypothesis</th><th>Prior</th>
    <th>Likelihood of being shown door 3</th><th>Posterior</th></tr>
    <tr><td>door 1</td><td>33.3%</td><td>33.3%</td><td>33.3%</td></tr> <tr><td>door 2</td><td>33.3%</td><td>66.7%</td><td>66.7%</td></tr> <tr><td>door 3</td><td>33.3%</td><td>0.0%</td><td>0.0%</td></tr>
</table><p>So we should switch!</p>
